# 🏫 Dominion Intelligent Builder Academic School Portal (DIBA Portal)

A robust, enterprise-grade, multi-tier School Management System (SMS) built for **Dominion Intelligent Builder Academic School**. The platform features a secure **ASP.NET Core Web API** backend and a modern **React & TypeScript** frontend, designed to manage the complete academic lifecycle—from admissions and fee processing to continuous assessments and automated result generation.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 9/8), Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET Core Identity, JWT Authentication, PostgreSQL / MS SQL Server.
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, Axios, Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS.
*   **Infrastructure & Services:** Redis (Distributed Caching), Paystack / Flutterwave Webhooks (Payment Gateway), QuestPDF / DinkToPdf (Report Card Generation).

---

## 🏛️ System Architecture & Database Models

The backend utilizes Entity Framework Core structured into clean, modular functional domains:

### 1. System, Security & Audit
*   **`ApplicationUser`**: Extends `IdentityUser` with custom profile metadata (`FirstName`, `LastName`, `ProfilePictureUrl`, `IsActive`).
*   **`AuditLog`**: Tracks critical administrative actions, record modifications (old vs. new values), user IDs, IP addresses, and timestamps.
*   **`NotificationLog`**: Records automated email, SMS, and in-app alerts dispatched to students, parents, and staff.

### 2. Academic Structure & Setup
*   **`Session`**: Represents academic years (e.g., `2026/2027`) with active state tracking.
*   **`Term`**: Term subdivisions (`First Term`, `Second Term`, `Third Term`).
*   **`Section`**: Major academic divisions (Enum: `Nursery`, `Primary`, `JuniorSecondary`, `SeniorSecondary`).
*   **`ClassLevel`**: Grade tiers (`Primary 1`, `JSS 1`, `SS 3`).
*   **`ClassRoom` (Class Arms)**: Specific classroom streams (e.g., `JSS 1A`, `JSS 1B`) assigned to specific Form Teachers.

### 3. Curriculum & Enrollment
*   **`Subject`**: Master course directory (`Mathematics`, `Basic Science`, etc.).
*   **`ClassSubject`**: Junction table mapping which subjects are taught in specific class levels.
*   **`StudentProfile` & `TeacherProfile`**: Extended user metadata and institutional identification numbers.
*   **`Enrollment`**: Tracks student placement in a specific `ClassRoom` for a given term and session.

### 4. Assessment & Result Processing
*   **`AssessmentConfig`**: Configures grading components and percentage weights per term (e.g., Test 1: 10%, Test 2: 10%, Exam: 80%).
*   **`ScoreEntry`**: Individual student mark entries per assessment component.
*   **`TermResult`**: Aggregated performance summary containing total marks, averages, class positions, and teacher remarks.

### 5. Finance & Fee Management
*   **`FeeCategory`**: Expense types (`Tuition`, `Uniform`, `ICT Levy`, `Laboratory Fee`).
*   **`FeeStructure`**: Financial pricing mapped to specific class levels and terms.
*   **`StudentInvoice`**: Billed liabilities generated for enrolled students.
*   **`PaymentTransaction`**: Payment gateway webhook logs, reference hashes, and financial reconciliation channels.

## 🔐 Scalable Administrative Hierarchy & Roles (RBAC)

To reflect the school's precise management structure, the portal uses a granular, tiered Role-Based Access Control matrix configured via ASP.NET Core Identity:

| Role Name | Organizational Level & Core Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`SuperAdmin`** | Platform owner; manages system infrastructure, multi-tenant databases, global licenses, and master configurations. |
| **`Principal`** | Chief Executive Academic Officer; holds ultimate institutional oversight over senior sections, signs off final terminal report cards, and approves staff evaluations. |
| **`Headmaster` / `Headmistress`** | Administrative head for primary and nursery sections; oversees junior student discipline, attendance tracking, and primary class allocations. |
| **`VicePrincipal`** | Executive assistant to the Principal; manages daily timetables, disciplinary committees, academic scheduling, and teacher oversight. |
| **`SchoolAdmin`** | Operations manager; handles general day-to-day configuration, user account creation, password resets, and announcements. |
| **`Bursar` / `Accountant`** | Dedicated financial management; handles fee structures, student invoices, payment gateway reconciliation, and debt tracing. |
| **`Registrar`** | Manages admissions, student registration numbers, enrollment cycles, and class arm placements. |
| **`Teacher`** | Subject instructors; inputs continuous assessment/exam marks, records subject attendance, and uploads lesson notes. |
| **`FormTeacher`** | Upgraded teacher role with clearance to review class-wide performance, track general behavior, and write terminal remarks. |
| **`Student`** | End-user portal access for viewing personal timetables, assignments, published result sheets, and fee history. |
| **`Parent` / `Guardian`** | Family portal access to link multiple children across sections, track attendance/results, and pay school fees online. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Backend Setup (.NET API)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend/OnlineVotingApplication

```

2. Configure your database connection string in `appsettings.json`:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=DIBA_Portal_Db;Username=postgres;Password=yourpassword"
}

```


3. Run database migrations:
```bash
dotnet ef database update

```


4. Start the API server:
```bash
dotnet run

```



### 2. Frontend Setup (React & Vite)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend

```


2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install

```


3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev

```

## 🔌 Core API Endpoints Reference

The backend exposes RESTful endpoints secured via JWT Bearer tokens:

* **Authentication (`/api/auth`)**
* `POST /login` - Authenticates users and returns JWT access/refresh tokens.
* `POST /register` - Registers new portal users (restricted by role).


* **User & Role Administration (`/api/admin/users`)**
* `GET /all` - Retrieves paginated system users with stats and role filters.
* `POST /penalty-lockout` - Applies a 100-year administrative penalty lockout with audit logging.


* **Academic Structure (`/api/academic`)**
* `GET /sessions` - Lists academic sessions and active terms.
* `POST /class-rooms` - Manages class arms and student allocations.


* **Grading & Results (`/api/results`)**
* `POST /scores` - Inputs continuous assessment and exam marks by authorized teachers.
* `GET /terminal-report/{studentId}` - Compiles and calculates term results, averages, and positions.


* **Finance (`/api/finance`)**
* `POST /invoices` - Generates student fee liabilities.
* `POST /webhook/paystack` - Processes automated payment gateway confirmations and receipts.

## 🛡️ Security & Architecture Best Practices

* **Token-Based Security:** Stateless JWT authentication paired with secure HTTP-only cookies or encrypted local storage headers.
* **Data Isolation:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforced via ASP.NET Core `[Authorize(Roles = "...")]` attributes on controllers and specific endpoint actions.
* **Audit Compliance:** Every critical mutation (such as penalty lockouts, grade updates, and fee waivers) is captured automatically via middleware into the `AuditLog` table.
* **Input Validation:** Comprehensive model state validation on both the API DTOs and React forms to prevent injection and invalid relational mappings.
